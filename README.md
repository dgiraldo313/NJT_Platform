# NJT_Platform BOT
Personal bot to get train track info once it has been announced at NYC Penn Station.

Anyone who has ever commuted to NYC through Penn Station knows how chaotic it can get, especially during peak hours. This bot was an effort to reduce this chaos by knowing which track my train would be on, so that I could make my way directly to the platform without having to look at the announcement boards. This was a very helpful tool for me, especially on those days that I would get out of the office with just enough time to get to the train station. All I would have to do was visit the URL, which was bookmarked on my work computer, right before I left the office and then during my walk over to the train (Once the platform was announced) I would automatically get an SMS text message with all the details, including boarding time (sometimes these changed) and train number. And that was it, simple but effective!

PS - I never got to finish this project because I ran into some restraints with NJT's API, but would love to adapt it for other lines in the future. It all depends on how much NJT decides to improve their API.
